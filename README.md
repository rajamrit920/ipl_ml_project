# 🏏 IPL Score Prediction using Machine Learning  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project aims to predict the final score of an IPL match using **machine learning algorithms** based on real-time match parameters such as current score, overs, wickets, and historical match data. By leveraging advanced models like **Random Forest, KNN, and AdaBoost**, the system provides accurate predictions to assist analysts, fans, and coaches in understanding game dynamics. Additionally, the project includes **data visualization** features for insights into player statistics and match trends.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
The project is developed using **Python** with key libraries such as **Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn** for data processing and model training. For web-based interaction, **Flask and Streamlit** are used to create a user-friendly interface. The dataset is sourced from **historical IPL match records**, cleaned, and preprocessed to enhance model performance. Version control is managed using **Git**, ensuring efficient collaboration and updates.  

## 🔥 Model Performance  
The machine learning models achieve high accuracy in predicting IPL match scores. The **Random Forest model** provides the best performance with **85% accuracy**, followed by **AdaBoost at 83%** and **KNN at 78%**. These models are trained on historical match data, considering factors like runs, overs, wickets, and team strategies.  


## 📊 Results and Future Enhancements  
The project successfully predicts **match scores with high accuracy**, providing users with an interactive **dashboard** to visualize **player stats and match outcomes**. Future improvements include **deep learning integration** for better accuracy, **live API support** for real-time match data, and **advanced feature engineering** to enhance predictions.
